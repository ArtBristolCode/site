## **What is P5.js?**
P5.js is a JavaScript language that is designed to make coding accessible. It was designed by artists and technologists and can be used to make lots of different kinds of programs including sound, visuals etc.

P5.JS was designed so that it can be easily added to a website - which means you can share what you have made!
